/* There is a plane that can onboard passengers. Whenever plane takes off the date of taking off has to be updated. Same with landing
 Start by creating a class called Plane.
Add a constructor that initializes the values of maxPassengers and the array passengers to an empty array.
Change the access modifier of the four variables to private.
Add the following methods to the Plane class:
onboard(): add passengers to the array using the add() method
takeOff(): returns the current date and time
land(): sets the value of lastTimeLanded to the current date and time. Also clear() the array.
getLastTimeLanded(): returns the value of lastTimeLanded.
getPassesngers(): returns the array of passengers.

Create another class named EncapsulationActivity. In this class we will have our main method.
First create an object of the Plane class named plane. Set the maxPassengers value to 10 by passing it to the constructor.
Add names to the passengers list using the onboard method.
Print the take-off time using the takeOff() method.
Print the list of passengers using the getPassengers() method.
Add a Thread.sleep() method to pause execution for 5 seconds. This is to emulate plane in flight.
Land() the plane and print the time of landing using getLastTimeLanded() method
