package JavaActivity2;
/*
 Start by creating two interfaces - BicycleParts and BicycleOperations
In BicycleParts:
public int gears: number of gears on the bicycle
public int speed: max speed of bicycle
In BicycleOperations:
public applyBrake(int decrement): how much to slow down the bicycle by.
public speedUp(int increment): how much to speed up the bicycle by.
Next create the base class Bicycle. It implements both interfaces BicycleParts, BicycleOperations.
Initialize the values of gears and currentSpeed in a constructor.
Write the definition of the applyBrake() and speedUp().
applyBrake() reduces the currentSpeed by the number passed to the method.
speedUp() increases the currentSpeed by the number passed to the method.
Add another method to the base class - bicycleDesc().
It prints the number of gears and the currentSpeed of the bicycle.
Now create a derived class, MountainBike that extends Bicycle.
This class adds another property: seatHeight.
In the constructor for MountainBike, use the super keyword to include gears and currentSpeed for this class. Also initialize seatHeight.
Add setHeight() method to the class to add a new value for the seatHeight variable.
Override the bicycleDesc() method of the super class to print the seat height also.
Finally we make the driver class that contains the main method.
Create an object for the MountainBike class.
Use this object to access the different variables and methods.
